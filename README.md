# Working with Images #

## JavaScript only ##

The whole idea of these pages is to use JavaScript
to bring the images to life on the page and 
learning to bring images into line with each other.

Using different colours of pictures of different
effects and also using the fader in javaScript 
to bring the image in and out of the screen.

The second part of the screen was to develop
the images in a thumbnail style allowing the 
user to pick the images that they wish from the 
choices at the bottom. 

Working with the getElements and mouseover 
techniques to get this to work.
